bisection_method:  Divides the interval [a, b] repeatedly until the width of the interval is less than epsilon. Uses the Intermediate Value Theorem to ensure a root exists in the interval. false_position_method:  Similar to Bisection but calculates the root using a linear approximation formula. Adjusts the interval bounds [a, b] based on the sign
