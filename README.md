# Computational Mathematics - Root Finding Methods

## Description
This repository contains Python code that implements two root-finding methods: 
1. **Bisection Method**
2. **Method of False Position (Regula Falsi)**

These methods are commonly used in numerical analysis to find the roots of nonlinear equations. The code allows users to input a function, interval bounds, and tolerance to compute the root of the function using the selected method. 

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script `Practice_1_2_Computational_Mathematics.py` in a Python environment.
3. You will be prompted to select one of the two root-finding methods and provide the necessary inputs (e.g., function, interval bounds, tolerance).
4. The program will compute the root and display the result in the console along with a convergence graph.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` library for plotting graphs

You can install `matplotlib` using pip:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
